# Snomed2Vec
New approach to use Snomed-CT Concept using *Word Embedding* with **Word2vec**
## Introduction
**Snomed2Vec** is a tool to identify the clinical concept from clinical text report o with simple sentences. We can test a diagnostic, procedure, sustances, etc...

To identify de clinical concept we use the clinical Ontology **Snomed-CT** and to get the semantic relation from the word of the text, we use the model **Word Embedding"** Word2Vec.
This documentation is part of my PH.D. develop to improve and share this new approach.

## Prerequisites
We use Python library gensim, for Word2Vec model.

## Ontology Snomed-CT Processing 
The first step is prepare the Snomed-CT structure to apply the model and the tool.
  
## Word Embedding. Train the model "Word2Vec" 

## Methods 

  
## Representation Learning 
Prueba
  ```
  python Snomed2Vec.py *"sentence test"*
  ```
  This script will create a file with the vector representations of all classes in *AllClasses.lst*. This file, *VecResults.lst*, is the final and main output of Onto2Vec. 

## Final notes
For any comments or help needed with how to test *Snomed2Vec* tool, you can write to: imsoriano67@gmail.com
